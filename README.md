**Game Filtering and Discount Management Program**

This project is a command-line tool that allows users to filter and display video games based on various criteria such as release year, developer, genre, and discount availability. It processes data from two CSV files: one containing information about the games and another detailing available discounts.

**Features**

- Filter games by developer: Find games developed by a particular developer.
- Filter games by genre: Search for games within a specific genre.
- Games by developer and year: Filter games by a specific developer within a specific year.
- Games without discounts by genre: Find games in a specific genre that are not currently discounted.
- Games with discounts by developer: Search for games by a specific developer that have discounts.
